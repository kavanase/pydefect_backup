# Welcome to PyDefect manual page #

## Introduction
PyDefect is a robust, open-source Python library for point-defect calculations in non-metallic solids based on first-principle calculations. 
In principle, PyDefect supposes to use the [VASP](https://www.vasp.at) code.

Although PyDefect is free to use, we really appreciate if you help us to improve this library. 
The simplest but most valuable contribution is to send the feature requests and bug reports.
Please report any bugs and issues at PyDefect's [Github Issues page](https://github.com/oba-group/pydefect).
