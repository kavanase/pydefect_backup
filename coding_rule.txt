Based on coding rule of pymatgen of Materials Project.

Naming:
	Function:
		Use verb firstly.
		Write by small capital and use underscore.
		e.g.
			move_directory(src, dist)	
			read_setting(filename)

Spacing:
	- Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces (PEP8)
	e.g.
		OK: function(array[1], {key: 2})
		NG: function( array[1], { key: 2 } )

	- Excepting above brackets rule,
	 place one whitespace before/after operator.
	 e.g.
		OK: function(1 + 2)
			 a = (-b + c) * 2
		NG: function(1+2)
			 a=(-b+c)*2
			 a = ( -b + c) * 2
Line break:
