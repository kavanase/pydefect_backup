		NG : function( array[1], { key: 2 } )

	-Excepting above brackets rule,
	 place one whitespace before/after operator.
	 e.g.

			 a = (-b + c) * 2
		NG : function(1+2)
			 a=(-b+c)*2
			 a = ( -b + c) * 2
	
	-However, when keyward argument, no need to use space. (PEP8)

					  egg,
					  42,
					  longlongname)
